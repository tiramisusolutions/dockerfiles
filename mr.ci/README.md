# mr.docs

mr.docs is a [Docker container](https://docker.com "Homepage of docker"), which can help you with testing documentation written in [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). 

mr.docs is written as a personal tool, to improve the [documentation of Plone](http://docs.plone.org).

It comes with a pre-configured list 'of good known words' based on typical terms used within [Plone](https://plone.org). 

## Features

- Small Image, based on [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/).
- You do not need to install sphinx locally.
- Pre-configured with different add-ons.
- A new, clean and 'fresh' build with every test run.
